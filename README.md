# Asteroids Game Clone
This game prototype was made as a test task.
Main idea of what inside is to not use any of 3rd-party libs or frameworks.
I tried to make my own version of tools I often use as simple as possible. I recreated tools like:
- Dependency Injection - I made it super simple and it have no full package of functionality it may have.
- EventDispatcher - simple implementation of observer pattern
## Summary
In this way this project seems to be overwhelmed with different stuff and approaches. But most decisions I made were driven by one main thought - "extensibility".
